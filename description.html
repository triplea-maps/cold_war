<br>October 1962: Cuban Missile Crisis
<br>
<br>Instead of following demands by the U.S. to remove missiles in Cuba, Cuba is aligned with the United Soviet Socialist Republics(USSR) to not follow those orders,
    which then leads to war between the North Atlantic Trade Organisation(NATO) members and the Warsaw-Pact members including Cuba.
